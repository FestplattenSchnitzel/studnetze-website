**FAQ**

-   As soon as you arrive at the Tusculum registration desk, you get a
    public transportation ticket for the duration of the SNT. Yes, all
    of you! However, you have to find the way (and a single public
    transportation ticket) to the Tusculum yourself.
-   You do not need to bring towels or bed sheets, the accomodation
    provides everything.
-   If you already know that you will not arrive between 15:00 and 18:00
    at the Tusculum on Thursday, don\'t worry, this is not a problem,
    just inform us about it so we know you are not missing (or can
    expect you earlier).
