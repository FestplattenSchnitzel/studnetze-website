## Questions & Answers

Below you can find some useful information about how to get to the
Strahov dormitory or how public transport in Prague works.

### How to get to the Strahov dormitory?

The first place to visit is the SNT18 HQ, located at Olympijská 2
[(50.0818819N, 14.3930931E)](https://en.mapy.cz/s/2VQO0). There are
generally two options how to get there: by public transport or by car.

#### By public transport

Buy a 90-minute public transport ticket (CZK 32, cca. €1.30). You can
get one in a vending machine (almost all of them accept payment by
card).

Please do not forget to validate your ticket upon entering the bus/tram
the first time. To do so, find a yellow ticket validating machine. If
you would like to use the Prague Metro, please find the ticket
validating machines at the entrance to the platforms.

query="?130"} ![Ticket validating
machine](/snt/2018/guides/validator_metro.jpg){width="180" query="?180"}

-   **Arriving at the Prague airport**
    -   Get the transport ticket at the information center at the
        airport, or use the vending machine by the bus stop, which is in
        front of the airport (it also accepts cards).
    -   Take bus 191 in direction "Na Knížecí". The bus stop is in front
        of the airport.
    -   Get off at the station "Stadion Strahov". The journey should
        take 37 minutes.
    -   You can reach the dormitory by foot (5 mins) or take the bus
        line 143 or 149 to the next stop "Koleje Strahov".
-   **Arriving at the Praha hlavní nádraží train station**
    -   Take the tram No. 9 from "Hlavní nádraží" to "Švandovo divadlo"
        tram stop.
    -   Then transfer to the bus line 176 in direction "Stadion
        Strahov", which is your final stop.
    -   You can reach the dormitory by foot (5 mins) or take bus line
        143 or 149 to the next stop "Koleje Strahov".

-   **Arriving at the Praha, Florenc bus station**
    -   *Option 1*
        -   Cross the big street on the north, preferably by using the
            underground tunnel, and go north until you find a tram stop
            at "Sokolovská" street. The longest corridor in that tunnel
            should lead you right to the tram stop.
        -   Take the tram No. 8 (direction "Nádraží Podbaba") to
            "Vítězné náměstí" tram stop.
        -   Walk up the "Svatovítská" street, away from the roundabout,
            until you come to a bus stop "Kafkova". It's about 100m
            away, on the west side of the road.
        -   Take the bus line 143 or 149. Get off the bus at "Koleje
            Strahov".
    -   *Option 2*
        -   Descend to the underground (metro) station, line C (red).
            Take the train in direction "Letňany", and get off at the
            next stop, which is "Vltavská".
        -   Exit the underground and take the tram No. 1 (direction
            "Sídliště Petřiny") or No. 25 (direction "Bílá Hora").
        -   Get off at the station "Prašný most".
        -   Take the bus line 143 or 149 from "Prašný most" to "Koleje
            Strahov".

-   **Arriving at the Praha, Anděl bus station**
    -   Take the bus line 191. Get off the bus at "Stadion Strahov"
        station.
    -   You can reach the dormitory by foot (5 mins) or take bus line
        143 or 149 to the next stop "Koleje Strahov".

#### By car

-   Navigate to Olympijská 2 (50.0818819N, 14.3930931E) :-)
-   Parking available within the dormitory.

### Coming earlier, leaving later?

If you are still wondering what places to visit in Prague prior to the
SNT or after it, you might take a look at the [Honest Guide
(EN)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO96JVSM5Y0&list=PLM9_KZNJw8qGuEHJf4lcfIiGwpiRtcKAm).
This series contains useful information about where to eat, interesting
places to visit and things to be aware of.

### Do you need any cash?

The accommodation and food will be provided by us, so you do not have to
care about it. Also, you will get public transport tickets valid from
24th to 26th from us. Apart from your own expenditures you should not
need any cash. Most of the shops and restaurants accept payment cards.
Notable exceptions are some public transport ticket machines (see above)
and the [Restaurant Petrin (CZ)](http://restaurant-petrin.cz/) located
in the Strahov dormitory. To check the currency exchange rate, you can
use this [Fast Currency Converter
(EN)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.currencyconverter)
app for Android.

If, for any reason, you need the cash, avoid exchanging your money at
the airport/train station and always ask how much money you are going to
get (nominal rate 1 EUR \~ 25 CZK). If you withdraw from the ATM, always
prefer those which are indoors, and decline the integrated currency
conversion (DCC) and accept the value in CZK. You will then get the
exchange rate of your bank, which is always much better.
