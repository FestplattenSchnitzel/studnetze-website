# Welcome!

In many European university cities, there are independent student networks which provide Internet access for tenants in the dormitories, look after the technical equipment and sometimes take over the administration completely on their own. This site aims to collect information about as many of these networks as possible and to serve the networks themselves as a presentation and communication platform.

This also promotes the cooperation of the individual student networks and joint projects, such as the annual student network meeting (German: Studentennetztreffen, hence the acronym "SNT") , Voice-over-IP solutions or streaming, deepen the contacts.

Since [SNT 2017](/SNT/SNT2017), we expanded our network internationally - with guests from Prague being the first ones to join! In the following year, [SNT 2018](/SNT/SNT2018) was hosted in Prague and for [SNT 2019](/SNT/SNT2019) we were guests in Bratislava!

## News

The [SNT 2023](/SNT/SNT2023) will take place in Dresden.
